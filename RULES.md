# Pavra Project Rules

This document outlines the development rules and functional requirements for the Pavra project. All team members must follow these rules to ensure consistency, usability, and maintainability of the application.

## 1. ASO Optimization
- The application must implement **complete and standard App Store Optimization (ASO)** practices.  
- Ensure the **app name, short description, and long description** include relevant, high-value keywords.  
- Use **high-quality app icons, screenshots, and preview videos** to improve visual appeal and conversion rate.  
- Maintain a **clear and consistent brand identity** across store listings and in-app visuals.  
- Encourage **positive user reviews and regular updates** to boost store ranking.  
- Optimize **app categories and tags** to reach the right target audience.  
- Localize **store listing text and images** for each supported language.

## 4. Code Comments
- All functions, methods, and classes must have **English comments** explaining their purpose.
- Comments should describe **what the function does, its parameters, and return values** if applicable.
- Avoid writing comments in other languages for code clarity.

## 5. Multi-Language Support
- Pavra must support **English and Chinese translations**.
